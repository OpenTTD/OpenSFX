1.0) About OpenSFX
==== =============
OpenSFX is a set of base sounds for OpenTTD and is the result of the
"Sound Effects Replacement" project.

OpenSFX is a replacement for the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe
base sounds used by OpenTTD. The main goal of OpenSFX therefore
is to provide a set of free sounds which make it possible to play
OpenTTD without requiring the (copyrighted) files from the Transport
Tycoon Deluxe CD.

The OpenSFX sounds are free as in 'free beer' and free
as in 'freedom'.

1.1) License
==== =======
OpenSFX is free software, you are allowed to freely use, copy, modify and
share this, even commercially, as long you follow the licenses.

    Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported
license.

2.0) Installing
==== ==========
OpenSFX is available from at least three locations. This readme will
only cover the official download locations. We cannot support third
party download locations and we cannot refund your money if you have
paid money for OpenSFX.

There are three ways to get the latest stable release:
  * If you are new to OpenTTD, you do not have access to the original
    Tranport Tycoon Deluxe files and you are using the Windows installer
    to install OpenTTD you can select OpenSFX to be downloaded during
    the installation of OpenTTD.

  * If you are new to OpenTTD and do not have access to the original
    Tranport Tycoon Deluxe files, you will have to download and install
    OpenSFX manually. This is really not that difficult as it may
    sound, so do not worry too much about that.
      o Download location:
          https://www.openttd.org/downloads/opensfx-releases/latest.html
      o Installation instructions:
          Installing OpenSFX Manually.

  * If you already have OpenTTD up and running, the in-game Online Content
    service is the easy way to obtain OpenSFX.
      o Download location:
          use the in-game Online content service
      o Installation instructions:
          Installing OpenSFX using the Online Content service.

2.1) Installing OpenSFX Manually
==== ===========================
1. First, make sure that you have downloaded and installed at least
   OpenTTD version 1.0.0 or a recent nightly.
2. Next, download the latest OpenSFX package. (stable nightly)
3. Unpack the zip into the OpenTTD's /baseset directory. There is no
   need to unpack the tar file, so just leave it as it is. Your
   OpenTTD /baseset directory is either located in:
      * An OpenTTD folder in your user account's home directory:
          * Windows: C:\Users\<username>\Documents\OpenTTD
          * macOS: ~/Documents/OpenTTD

   window using the × in the upper left corner.
      * If you did not install the original Tranport Tycoon Deluxe base
        sounds during the installation of OpenTTD, you can skip this step.
      * If you installed the original Tranport Tycoon Deluxe base sounds
        as well, this is where you can switch base sound sets.

2.2) Installing or Updating OpenSFX using the Online Content service

3.2) Contributing
==== ============
Contributing to OpenSFX can be done in several ways, but they generally end
up with providing (improved) samples for the set. If you have got a better
sample than we currently have you can make that know via an issue at:
> https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenSFX/issues
Please mention who made the original samples and that the sample has been
released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported
